## Description of the Project:
We are developing a simplified web application for book publishing, inspired by Book Bolt. The primary goal is to provide authors and self-publishers with essential tools to streamline the publishing process, focusing on features such as book cover creation, basic keyword research, and simple formatting options.

## Learning Objectives:

- Gain practical experience in full-stack web development.
- Understand the process of integrating third-party APIs into a web application.
- Improve skills in frontend design and development.
- Learn to prioritize features and manage project scope effectively.


## Technologies Used:

- Backend: Node.js with Express framework for RESTful API development, MongoDB for database storage.

- Frontend: React.js for building the user interface.
Additional Tools: Git for version control, Trello for project management, Figma for Mockup creation.

## Third-Party Services Used (if applicable):

- Unsplash API for accessing royalty-free images for book covers.
- Keyword Tool API for basic keyword research functionality.

## Challenges Already Identified:

- Integrating multiple third-party APIs and ensuring smooth communication between frontend and backend.
- Designing a user-friendly interface that simplifies the publishing process without sacrificing essential features.
- Managing project scope to deliver a functional MVP within the limited timeframe.
